SDShare Push
============

SDShare Push is a simple HTTP-based protocol for feeding changes to an
upstream data source into a downstream receiver. The protocol is
designed to be used together with [SDShare](http://sdshare.org).

See [the SDShare Push spec](spec.md) for more information.

This repo will eventually hold tools for building SDShare Push
receivers.
